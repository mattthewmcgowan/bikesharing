## Summary: 

The purpose of this analysis was to make a business case for starting a business similar Citi Bike in De Moines, Iowa. The analysis does give insight into how a service like Citi Bike might be used. For example, trends could remain the same as far as ridership time assuming that the population would use the bikes for thier morning and afternoon commute. With that in mind, one has to consider the total distance travelled is between 10-15 minutes. If making the case the bike service would serve it's purpose in the morning/afternoon commute one would have to understand the relative commuting distance in Des Moines. I would suspect New York City's population density allows for non-car commuting more naturally than in Des Moines. On the topic of population density, the business case would benefit from another anlysis between Des Moines and another city of relative size. An additional visualization that would help would be to understand where the bikes are being ridden too. We can see their geographical location but we don't know if that destination is work, school, etc.. Another visualization that would be helpful would be to understand how many are lost due to theft or permentant damage.
